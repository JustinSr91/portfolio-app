          <p className="p-bio"> Eager Junior Developer that posseses a never ending passion for learning and improvement. Iâ€™ve worked with Front End tools and languages such as JavaScript, React.js, HTML5, CSS3, and have utilized Node.js, Express, and Heroku for deployment of web applications. I also very frequently utilize Git/Github. My wish is to continue to pick up cool new skills as a Developer and selflessly deliver creative solutions to my employer, teammates, and clients. I believe my strongest attribute is my willingness and ability to be taught, so I pick up new concepts very quickly. I also really enjoy coffee.
